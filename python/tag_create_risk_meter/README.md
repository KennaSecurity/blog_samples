# Risk Meter Creation

Create risk meters from asset tags.

This directory contains two files:

* create_risk_meter.py - Creates risk meters based on the tags containing `bu: <business_unit>`. The file `business_units will be created automatically and is used for created risk meters.
* site_create_risk_meter.py - Creates risk meters based on tages contain `site: <site>`. The Kenna Security server is used to determine if the risk meter is already exists.
