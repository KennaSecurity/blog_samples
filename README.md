# Kenna Security Blog Samples

These scripts accompany the Kenna blogs. 

The [Kenna Security REST API](https://apidocs.kennasecurity.com/reference) samples provided are in
different languages.  Each language will have its own development environment and different samples.
For example Python could have assets and vulnerabilities samples, whereas PowerShell has assets and
asset group samples.

For more samples, please look at our [All_Samples](https://github.com/KennaSecurity/All_Samples)
repository.  There you will find many samples, mostly in Ruby.

For additional information about how you can use the Kenna API (employed in the sample scripts)
to enhance/supplement your Kenna implementation, contact
[Kenna Customer Success](mailto:customersuccess@kennascurity.com).

All the code samples in this GitHub repository are offered “as is” and include no warranty of any kind.
Use them at your own risk. In no event will Kenna be liable to end user or any other party for damages
of any kind arising from the use of these samples.
